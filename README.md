# Challenges

This is a single repo to hold all of my solutions to several challenges.
These challenges come in every flavor, goal, language, and platform,
and this repo will be made up of whatever language i decided to use that moment.
some challenges may be answered several times, in several langues, techniques or anything else.

This is all Open Source (GPL), and is available for free to learn from, adapt, distribute, or even find a real use for.
That said, please don't use them to just solve the challenges yourself. Please try them honestly.
Challenges are supposed to be challenging and educational, and using others' code to solve them easily 
diminishes others accomplishments and makes it less fun for everyone.
