Matasano-Python
--------------------

This repository is for the purposes of:
- Learning Crypto better
- Continued improvement of Python Skills
- To relieve boredom.
- To be the very best. like no1 ever was!
    
Structure
----------------

Each set will contain two files:
- sXfun.py - contains all functions for set X
- setX.py - contains all actual code for all challenges in set

this may change as code becomes too long to house in one file,
but currently set one was short and easy to conform to this standard.


Other Conventions that i'll maybe keep to sometimes
------------------------------
certain variables that are only needed in their own challenges
will follow a naming convention. this is as follows:

- thestr = a given string to either be encrypted or decrypted.
- thekey = a given key to be used for either encryption or decryption
- cXexpect = the expected answer when given (such as S1c1 and S1c2)
- bestX = when many possibilities exist (scores, keys, etc)
  the most likely. i.e. bestkey, besthex (S1c4)

challenges will begin and end with a header/footer:
```
############### challenge X ##################
//place code here
##############################################
```

TODO: Cleanup the code structure.
